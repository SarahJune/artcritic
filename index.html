              <h3>I'm Lindy</h3>
              <p>I am an effective team-builder, recognizing strengths in others and cultivating a strong team dynamic. With over 10 years of experience, I have grown teams and developed programs from scratch.</p>
              <p>I am often presented a goal and then asked to write the roadmap. I earn the trust of others by staying cool in high-pressure environments.</p>
              <p>Whether through education, medical research, or fitness, my goal is to help the advancement of others.</p>
              <p>I equally enjoy Fast Company and Vogue, I believe nothing clears your head like a long run, I live my life according to my Google Calendar, and I think eating dessert is the secret to happiness.</p>

          <div>
            <p>In joining Fred Hutchinson, I was faced with a steep learning curve. Working in grant management requires serious attention to detail and guidelines. Unlike most positions, you are held to the standards of the external organizations from where you are requesting funding. Every dollar had to be accounted for, and since all of the projects are going on simultaneously there is a constant dance to prioritize what is most imperative.</p>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Oversaw a portfolio of <strong>20 projects</strong> with funding sourced from varying agencies, managing deadlines, allowable expenses, personnel pay, and spending plans</li>
              <li>Managed <strong>$4M</strong> in government and private foundation grant funding</li>
              <li>Reported on project milestones and budget allocation to external partners, consultants, sub-awardees, and project managers</li>
              <li>Compiled grant applications, preparing <strong>multi-million budget forecasts</strong>, budget justification, and application adherence</li>
              <li>Planned and executed <strong>multi-day symposiums and scientific conferences</strong>, organizing attendees from around the globe</li>
              <li>Orchestrated communication plans regarding project status, updates to external partners, consultants, sub-awardees, and project managers</li>
              <li>Worked directly with the graduate school programs, coordinating graduate student pay, academic progress, and funding opportunities</li>
