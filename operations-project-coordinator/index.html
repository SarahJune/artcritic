            <p>In joining Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, I was faced with a steep learning curve. Working in grant management requires serious attention to detail and guidelines. Unlike most positions, you are held to the standards of the external organizations from where you are requesting funding. Every dollar had to be accounted for, and since all of the projects are going on simultaneously there is a constant dance to prioritize what is most imperative. Through this role, I learned how to be meticulous, how to handle competing priorities, and mastered the ability to maintain composure while managing a high volume of projects.</p>
