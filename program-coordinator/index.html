            <p>During my time at Bodybuilding.com, I assisted in growing this department from a five-person team to over 250 employees in just a few years. This role was my first experience in wearing many, many hats with a startup.</p>
            <p>When I left Bodybuilding.com, I had a solid operational foundation. With this, I gained not only the ability to identify process weaknesses but also how to fix it, through defining and documenting the requirements and scope of what needed to be improved.</p>

            <p>During my time at Bodybuilding.com, I:</p>

              <li>Managed the reorganization of the Customer Service Deptartment (<strong>150 employees</strong>), resulting in a lowered cost per contact and increased representative response time</li>
              <li>Led a <strong>$10 million</strong> corporate office renovation project</li>
              <li>Worked closely with key business stakeholders to forecast and enforce a multi-million dollar yearly expense budget, including details on headcount and open positions</li>
              <li>Created system to recover as much "re-shipped" product as possible, leading to the recovery of <strong>thousands of dollars</strong> in lost product</li>
              <li>Acted as executive assistant to the VP, coordinating schedules, starting projects, calculating operational costs, creating budgets, booking travel, and more</li>
